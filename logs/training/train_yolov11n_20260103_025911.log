Class for computing evaluation metrics for Ultralytics YOLO models.

    Attributes:
        p (list): Precision for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        r (list): Recall for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        f1 (list): F1 score for each class. Shape: (nc,).
        all_ap (list): AP scores for all classes and all IoU thresholds. Shape: (nc, 10).
        ap_class_index (list): Index of class for each AP score. Shape: (nc,).
        nc (int): Number of classes.

    Methods:
        ap50: AP at IoU threshold of 0.5 for all classes.
        ap: AP at IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 for all classes.
        mp: Mean precision of all classes.
        mr: Mean recall of all classes.
        map50: Mean AP at IoU threshold of 0.5 for all classes.
        map75: Mean AP at IoU threshold of 0.75 for all classes.
        map: Mean AP at IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 for all classes.
        mean_results: Mean of results, returns mp, mr, map50, map.
        class_result: Class-aware result, returns p[i], r[i], ap50[i], ap[i].
        maps: mAP of each class.
        fitness: Model fitness as a weighted combination of metrics.
        update: Update metric attributes with new evaluation results.
        curves: Provides a list of curves for accessing specific metrics like precision, recall, F1, etc.
        curves_results: Provide a list of results for accessing specific metrics like precision, recall, F1, etc.
